# Outlink deflector for Reddit

A simple Android app which deflects out.reddit.com tracking links, allowing you to open links in
their appropriate apps rather than in the browser.

Essentially, it registers itself as a handler for `out.reddit.com`, extracts the (real) target URL
from the `https://out.reddit.com/...` URL and prompts Android to open it, as if the user had clicked
on the link directly.

Work in progress.
